# Command-Line Ruby Hangman
This project is part of the [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/) Ruby curriculum.
## Instructions
The game begins by selecting a random word 5-12 letters in length by retrieving a word file from a url. To win the game, correctly guess all the letters in the word or the word itself before using 6 incorrect guesses.

The game also contains a feature to save the current game at any time. You may choose to load a saved game file when starting, or begin a new game. Once a game is completed, it will automatically delete the save file if it exists.

## To Play
This game is available to play on [repl.it](https://replit.com/@wyliemickelson/Ruby-Hangman?v=1). Alternatively, you can download this repository and run main.rb on the command line.
